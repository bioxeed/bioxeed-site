# bioxeed's hugo website

## Based on the Victor-hugo boilerplate

This is a blog/portfolio site built using the [victor-hugo](https://github.com/netlify/victor-hugo) boilerplate.  It uses using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a static site generator and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) + [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as the asset pipeline.  Right now there's only some basic templating added and a hello world page.
